# Adding to documentation
Documents from the individual repositories of the ÂµONOS project (e.g. onos-config,
onos-topo) should be maintained in those projects.

This documentation will be visible in GitHub for each of these projects
individually and also collectively in through **mkdocs** with the
**onos-docs** project at
[https://docs.onosproject.org](https://docs.onosproject.org).

> Github and MkDocs (python based) each use their own renderer of Markdown to
> display the text in HTML.

Authors should ensure their Markdown should work in **both** situations. 

Rules for GitHub markdown are at [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Rules for MkDocs (Python) are at [https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

> The rules are mostly the same for both platforms, with the following caveats
>
>   * With the python interpreter there must be a new empty line before any ordered or unordered list
